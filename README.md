# CodSoft-Task1
In this code, the program generates a random number between the specified range (1 to 100) and prompts the user to guess the number. 
The user's guess is then compared to the generated number, and appropriate feedback is provided.
The user is allowed a maximum of 10 attempts to guess the number. 
The game can be played multiple times, and the score is calculated based on the number of attempts taken to guess the correct number in each round.
